- **Router:** Subinterfaces configured for VLAN 10 and VLAN 20.
- **IP Addressing:** 
  - VLAN 10: `192.168.1.62/26`
  - VLAN 20: `192.168.1.126/26`
  
## Files
- `switch_config.txt` â€“ Configuration for the Cisco switch.
- `router_config.txt` â€“ Configuration for the Cisco router.
  
## How to Use
1. Apply the switch configuration to a Cisco switch.
2. Apply the router configuration to a Cisco router.
3. Connect the switch to the router using a trunk link.
4. Ensure hosts in VLAN 10 and VLAN 20 can communicate via the router.
